## Project Title :- Flight Fare Predication

## Problem Statement

- Traveling through flights has become an integral part of today’s lifestyle as more and more people are opting for faster travelling options. The flight ticket prices increase or decrease every now and then depending on various factors like timing of the flights, destination, and duration of flights various occasions such as vacations or festive seasons. Therefore, having some basic idea of the flight fares before planning the trip will surely help many people save money and time.
 
- The main goal is to predict the fares of the flights based on different factors available in
the provided dataset.

## Approach

- The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Model Building, and Model Testing. Try out different machine learning algorithms that’s best fit for the above case.

## Data set 

```bash

## Steps

1.  Importing the Liberary
2.  Reading Dataset
3.  Data Preprocessing
4.  Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
5.  Handling Categorical as well as Numarical Data
7.  Performing Feature Selection
8.  Model Training 
9.  Making pkl file
10. Testing
11. Production
12. Deployment
